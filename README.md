# Nearby

A Web App that detects the location of a user and shows the nearest location of a minimum of 10 points of a selected keyword (such as amenity or landmark, e.g hospitals, pharmacies, bus stops, etc).

The app provides users the ability to see the nearest locations of a selected keyword based on their location and also show them the direction to the place they clicked. The user can also extend the distance/radius at which the locations should be provided.
